## How to use it
#### IMPORTANT NOTICE: You need jQuery to get it to work!
1. Clone this repo
2. Embed a canvas on your page with a preferred size. For example:<br/>
  ```
  <canvas id="myCanvas" width="500" height="500"></canvas>
  ```
  <br/>
  If you want the script to work automatically you have to set the id to "myCanvas" else you have to change it in the JavaScript file.
3. Now link the JavaScript file in a script tag on your site like this:
  ```
  <script type="text/javascript" src="scripts/script.js"></script>
  ```
4. Now add a background image to the canvas via CSS:<br/>
  ```
  background-image: url('../background.jpg');
  ```
5. Now it works - PROFIT!
